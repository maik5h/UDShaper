# UDShaper
UDShaper is a [wave shaper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waveshaper) audio effect that features two shaping functions which are used to distort the input audio in different ways. The shaping functions can be designed using a visual graph editor and all their parameters can be controlled by the built-in Envelope tool.

## Compatibility
UDShaper is a CLAP plugin, which is an open source audio plugin ABI. A list of hosts supporting CLAP can be found [here](https://clapdb.tech/category/hostsdaws). Currently, the plugin is under development and not yet tested for any hosts or systems apart from FL Studio on windows.
