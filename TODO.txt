The biggest and most noticeable TODOs of this project:

- PERFORMANCE Getting the modulation amount parameters (100 in current confiduration) each sample slows down processing MASSIVELY. Runs smooth when I quote it out. Should be called only once per buffer AT MOST. getLFOPhase does also call GetParam. Fix.

- BUG (FL Studio) UDShaper crashes on disable when chained after certain plugins (Fruity Limiter). Why??? Does not happen with other effects and can safely be put before Fruity Limmiter.

- The way link knobs are implemented is bad, atrocious even. Is there no iPlug2 way to do popup menus properly?????

MIGRATING TO IPLUG2:

- I dont think many if statements in OnParamChange are efficient... Maybe store references to IParam in individual elements so they can access them directly and dont rely on synchronizing internal values with IParams?

- Add default IText for all texts on plugin.

Else:

- How to use iPlug2 animations? There should be an alternative to setting the controls dirty in OnIdle() that maybe gives a higher and more stable framerate.

- Connecting LFOs and Moving points acts on the unmodulated base state of the curves. So do either: Disable this kind of editing while the host is playing OR (better?) make it work with the current UI modulation state.

- Logging is done by printing text to file. For reasons beyond me, the host i am using (FL Studio) does not support the CLAP logging feature. Meaningfull logging using the clap feature should still be added to the plugin.

- Hosts only perform undo/ redo actions when the changed parameter is properly reported. Reporting parameters is not possible with the current setup and dynamic number of ShapePoints and linked parameters. A maximum number of parameters must be defined and all parameters would have to be preallocated.

- shapeSine is very buggy. Also add shapeArcsine.

- Audio processing is automatically parallelized by CLAP, which makes some of the planned functionality impossible. 1. deciding whether the current sample is higher of lower than the previous one is not possible for the first sample in every batch. I "solved" that by comparing the first sample with the second one, which is a very good approximation but not perfectly accurate. 2. I want to normalize the distortion segment wise to each local maximum of the wave but again, the nearest local maximum might be outside of the current batch. Is there a way to get the whole buffer as list while still having the parallelization working?

- All parameters depending on a ModulatedParameter are retrieved using a get-function which recalculates the parameter every time it is needed. This is probably more often than necessary. Can this be made more efficient?

- I use my own (unparallelized) functions to create GUI visuals. By only updating elements that have changed their appereance this is still fast enough (on my machine). using a graphics library would probably be better.

- When duplicating a plugin instance, the name of the copy is always UDShaper_10 for some reason. This does not seem to cause any harm, but should be adressed at some point.

- FL Studio destroys and reinitializes plugin when loading a preset, so the current implementation works fine. If other hosts do not destroy the plugin, i.e. just load the parameters into the existing instance, some methods might cause problems (EnvelopeManager::loadState assumes that the three default Envelopes are there and not more).

- Editing of curve center positions and possibly point positions should be disabled while the host is playing. Currently ShapeEditors do not have access to the playback status, so maybe it is the easiest solution to disable inside UDShaper::processMouseDrag.

- For now having serialiazeState/ unserializeState methods in ShapeEditor and LFOController works, but I think when future versions are released, it is cleaner to have these methods separated and take a ShapeEditor/ LFOController object, as well as a version number as input.

- curve center y position should not be handled how it is right now: ModulatedParameter controls the position, which is translated to a power. Instead, the Modulated Parameter should control the power. This would also make it easier to improve the editing of curveCenter as discussed below.

No functionality, only convenience:

- It would be good if all active knobs are on the left and all inactive ones on the right. On disable, modulated parameters must be connected with the link corresponding to the new knob positions.

- When editing curveCenter, the center should not be set to the mouse position, but rather move slower the further from the center it is, to allow for more control. Also detach the exact position on the screen from the power value to allow for finer steps in power.

- Symbols in shapeEditor windows to indicate mode (arrow up/down, L/R, M/S, +/-)

- Enter text does not work properly SecondsBoxControl, switches to wrong format if <1s. I can not override OnTextEntryCompletion. Text entry is disabled for now.
