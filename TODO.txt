The biggest and most noticeable TODOs of this project:

- BUG crashes if last point is modulated in x-direction.

- (BUG (FL Studio) UDShaper crashes on disable when chained after certain plugins (Fruity Limiter). Why??? Does not happen with other effects and can safely be put before Fruity Limmiter.)
I could not reproduce this and will assume it has fixed itself, keeping this note so I can watch out for similar bugs in the future.

- The way link knobs are implemented is bad, atrocious even. Is there no iPlug2 way to do popup menus properly?????

- How to use iPlug2 animations? There should be an alternative to setting the controls dirty in OnIdle() that maybe gives a higher and more stable framerate.

- Connecting LFOs and Moving points acts on the unmodulated base state of the curves. So do either: Disable this kind of editing while the host is playing OR (better?) make it work with the current UI modulation state.

- Hosts only perform undo/ redo actions when the changed parameter is properly reported. Turning modulation links into parameters might be good user experience.

- shapeSine is very buggy. Also add shapeArcsine.

- Audio processing is automatically parallelized by CLAP, which makes some of the planned functionality impossible. 1. deciding whether the current sample is higher of lower than the previous one is not possible for the first sample in every batch. I "solved" that by comparing the first sample with the second one, which is a very good approximation but not perfectly accurate. 2. I want to normalize the distortion segment wise to each local maximum of the wave but again, the nearest local maximum might be outside of the current batch. Is there a way to get the whole buffer as list while still having the parallelization working?

- FL Studio destroys and reinitializes plugin when loading a preset, so the current implementation works fine. If other hosts do not destroy the plugin, i.e. just load the parameters into the existing instance, some methods might cause problems (EnvelopeManager::loadState assumes that the three default Envelopes are there and not more).

- For now having serialiazeState/ unserializeState methods in ShapeEditor and LFOController works, but I think when future versions are released, it is cleaner to have these methods separated and take a ShapeEditor/ LFOController object, as well as a version number as input.

No functionality, only convenience:

- It would be good if all active knobs are on the left and all inactive ones on the right. On disable, modulated parameters must be connected with the link corresponding to the new knob positions.

- Symbols in shapeEditor windows to indicate mode (arrow up/down, L/R, M/S, +/-)

- Enter text does not work properly SecondsBoxControl, switches to wrong format if <1s. I can not override OnTextEntryCompletion. Text entry is disabled for now.
