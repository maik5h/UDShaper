The biggest and most noticeable TODOs of this project:

MIGRATING TO IPLUG2:

- Implement the UIs of the UDShaper elements. I think it makes sense to have, instead of the previous renderGUI() method, a method in each class which adds the controls to a given graphics content.
  Classes left to rework:
  - LFOController (TODO modulation!!!!! (how?? different than before thats for sure))
  - FrequencyPanel (maybe rename to LFOFrequencyController)

- Implement saving and loading of states (How much does iPlug2 do/ allow there? Does it only save registered parameters or also internal state?)

- Can I get the exact song position for every audio buffer?? That would be important.

- Make the SecondsBoxControl background opaque (how? Maybe explicitly add a drawRect to Draw or behind it)

- I dont think many if statements in OnParamChange are efficient... Maybe store references to IParam in individual elements so they can access them directly and dont rely on synchronizing internal values with IParams?

- I might be able to get rid of the layout attributes and only use the layout classes to compute the layouts once. They were necessary before because I did the resizing manually but that is not required anymore.

- Get rid of the RELATIVE_WIDTH * GUIWidth stuff, not required, because iPlug does the resizing.

- Add default IText for all texts on plugin.

Else:

- Logging is done by printing text to file. For reasons beyond me, the host i am using (FL Studio) does not support the CLAP logging feature. Meaningfull logging using the clap feature should still be added to the plugin.

- Hosts only perform undo/ redo actions when the changed parameter is properly reported. Reporting parameters is not possible with the current setup and dynamic number of ShapePoints and linked parameters. A maximum number of parameters must be defined and all parameters would have to be preallocated.

- shapeSine is very buggy. Also add shapeArcsine.

- Audio processing is automatically parallelized by CLAP, which makes some of the planned functionality impossible. 1. deciding whether the current sample is higher of lower than the previous one is not possible for the first sample in every batch. I "solved" that by comparing the first sample with the second one, which is a very good approximation but not perfectly accurate. 2. I want to normalize the distortion segment wise to each local maximum of the wave but again, the nearest local maximum might be outside of the current batch. Is there a way to get the whole buffer as list while still having the parallelization working?

- All parameters depending on a ModulatedParameter are retrieved using a get-function which recalculates the parameter every time it is needed. This is probably more often than necessary. Can this be made more efficient?

- I use my own (unparallelized) functions to create GUI visuals. By only updating elements that have changed their appereance this is still fast enough (on my machine). using a graphics library would probably be better.

- When duplicating a plugin instance, the name of the copy is always UDShaper_10 for some reason. This does not seem to cause any harm, but should be adressed at some point.

- FL Studio destroys and reinitializes plugin when loading a preset, so the current implementation works fine. If other hosts do not destroy the plugin, i.e. just load the parameters into the existing instance, some methods might cause problems (EnvelopeManager::loadState assumes that the three default Envelopes are there and not more).

- Editing of curve center positions and possibly point positions should be disabled while the host is playing. Currently ShapeEditors do not have access to the playback status, so maybe it is the easiest solution to disable inside UDShaper::processMouseDrag.

No functionality, only convenience:

- When editing curveCenter, the center should not be set to the mouse position, but rather move slower the further from the center it is, to allow for more control. Also detach the exact position on the screen from the power value to allow for finer steps in power.

- Symbols in shapeEditor windows to indicate mode (arrow up/down, L/R, M/S, +/-)

- Envelope and related classes should be renamed to LFO, which is a more accurate term for their purpose.
