The biggest and most noticeable TODOs of this project:

- Currently, parameters can only be modulated by one envelope. The reason for that is that the envelopes add their offset to the parameterMod value, than clamp it, then the next envelope is processed. The correct way would be to add all offsets first and only then clamp it, or else there are weird jumps in the value when more than one envelope is modulating it. Doing this would require quite some changes in the modulation implementation and i think it is not urgent since modulation by one envelope should be fine in most cases.

- shapeSine is very buggy. Also add shapeArcsine.

- Audio processing is automatically parallelized by CLAP, which makes some of the planned functionality impossible. 1. deciding whether the current sample is higher of lower than the previous one is not possible for the first sample in every batch. I "solved" that by comparing the first sample with the second one, which is a very good approximation but not perfectly accurate. 2. I want to normalize the distortion segment wise to each local maximum of the wave but again, the nearest local maximum might be outside of the current batch. Is there a way to get the whole buffer as list while still having the parallelization working?

- Let user add, edit and remove modulation links.


No functionality, only convenience:

- When editing curveCenter, the center should not be set to the mouse position, but rather move slower the further from the center it is, to allow for more control. Also detach the exact position on the screen from the power value to allow for finer steps in power.

- Draw the curves independently from the current state, since audio is parallelized and parameter values will jump randomly.
