The biggest and most noticeable TODOs of this project:

- UDShaper::ProcessBlock needs to be cleaned a little, make finding POIs a method and put mMode switch outside of process loop.

- I would like to have a sliding average over samples to determine minima/maxima for normalizing. By setting the window size, the user can effectively choose the time scale on which normalization happens. That would be very cool but I dont know if it is computationally feasible.

- (BUG (FL Studio) UDShaper crashes on disable when chained after certain plugins (Fruity Limiter). Why??? Does not happen with other effects and can safely be put before Fruity Limmiter.)
I could not reproduce this and will assume it has fixed itself, keeping this note so I can watch out for similar bugs in the future.

- Change ShapeEditor::forward input and return types to iplug::sample.

- The way link knobs are implemented is bad, atrocious even. Is there no iPlug2 way to do popup menus properly?????

- How to use iPlug2 animations? There should be an alternative to setting the controls dirty in OnIdle() that maybe gives a higher and more stable framerate.

- Connecting LFOs and Moving points acts on the unmodulated base state of the curves. So do either: Disable this kind of editing while the host is playing OR (better?) make it work with the current UI modulation state.

- Hosts only perform undo/ redo actions when the changed parameter is properly reported. Turning modulation links into parameters might be good user experience.

- shapeSine is very buggy. Also add shapeArcsine.

- Add piecewise normalization.

- FL Studio destroys and reinitializes plugin when loading a preset, so the current implementation works fine. If other hosts do not destroy the plugin, i.e. just load the parameters into the existing instance, some methods might cause problems (EnvelopeManager::loadState assumes that the three default Envelopes are there and not more).

- For now having serialiazeState/ unserializeState methods in ShapeEditor and LFOController works, but I think when future versions are released, it is cleaner to have these methods separated and take a ShapeEditor/ LFOController object, as well as a version number as input.

No functionality, only convenience:

- The overall look of the plugin has to be improved, but this can wait until all functionality is implemented. Especially the 3D frame around the LFO selector panel must be removed and the label must be made much smaller. Currently there is not enough space for all these elements if a large number of LFOs is displayed.

- It would be good if all active knobs are on the left and all inactive ones on the right. An easy solution would be to add an array that maps every mod parameter to the corresponding point. Rearranging the knobs will only affect this intermediate layer. But I am hesitant to implement it, as it adds addtional calls to performance critical code. Solving this without such array would give better performance, but it turned out to be more challenging than expected and quite error prone.

- Symbols in shapeEditor windows to indicate mode (arrow up/down, L/R, M/S, +/-)

- Enter text does not work properly SecondsBoxControl, switches to wrong format if <1s. I can not override OnTextEntryCompletion. Text entry is disabled for now.
